***Part 1***
    *Installing and Creating Accounts* 
        DOWNLOAD WEBSTORM --- https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
        DOWNLOAD GIT --- https://git-scm.com/downloads
        CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT --- https://github.com/

   *Creating a Repository*
        1. Go to your new github account on the website and click the "New" button under repositories. 
        2. Give your repository a name and select either private or public (private is recommended if you do not want others to see what you are doing on github)
        3. Add a README file if you want others to know what your repository is for. 
    
   *Connecting github to webstorm* 
        Question: Why should you do this? 
        Answer: Webstorm has many useful features that pair with github. For instance, webstorm can diagnose and fix merge conflicts automatically. 

        1. Open Webstorm and press Ctrl+Alt+S to open System Preferences
        2. Select Version control Git. 
        3. Enter the path to the git.exe 
        4a. Add Github password to Webstorm so you can access it. 
            4b. In Webstorm, open System Preferences 
            4c. Select Appearance and Behavior ---> System Settings ---> Passwords
    
   *Committing to github* 
        Committing to github using VSCODE is very easy. 
        If you have a branch that needs to be saved, all you do is go to source control and click the checkmark above the thing you want to save. Add a message that explains what it is you are saving for your own benefit.
